      <p>Hi, my name’s Emma and I’m a software engineer. I’ve been working as a professional programmer for 3 years and it has been a really exciting journey. When I was working as a Salesforce Administrator at the San Antonio Humane Society, I had some exposure to what programming as a career could look like. While that role did not require any programming, I was always curious about how Salesforce as an applicaiton worked behind the scenes to provide me the views and functionality I used everday.</p>

<p>Around 2018, I started to notice billboards on my drive to work for a coding bootcamp and decided it was worth a look. Shortly after, I attended and completed Codeup’s web development bootcamp in San Antonio and while that was one of the harder things I’ve accomplished, it was one of the most fun times I’ve had.</p>

<p>I was hired at Brokerage Engine about 2 weeks before my actual graduation in Codeup. BrokerageEngine was a very small start up in San Antonio at that time and it was the best first programming job I could have asked for. Because of how small the development team was (<em>4 people, including myself and one of my classmates from Codeup</em>), I had the opportunity to touch every part of our codebase, learn completely new languages than what I had learned in my bootcamp, and I was lucky enough to have managers that invested in my career and enjoyed helping me grow and learn during that time. This job solidified my love for the career I had chosen.</p>

<p>In 2019, I started my next job at CaptureRx in San Antonio as well. This job gives me the opportunity to work with a different style of system architecture and have the experience of working and coordinating with a larger development team. I’ve had the opportunity to assist in preparing for an eventual move to Docker/Kubernetes and some exposure to AWS in addition to my day to day programmer responsibilities.</p>

Through the Geekdom Incubator system, it transformed into present day Pawtify, a shelter adopiton management app and the beginings of a full scale shelter management system. The project is just finished being taken through a Civic Tech focused incubator with GeekdomSA and the City of San Antonio and is being developed in NodeJs, React and GraphQL.</p>
